                <div id="consumer-rights" class="policy-content">
                    <h2>Consumer Rights Policy</h2>
                    <p>At BBS, our primary goal is to ensure that every client has a clear understanding of our services and feels fully supported at every stage of their interaction with us. We are dedicated to maintaining transparency, providing top-notch service, and addressing any concerns or questions you may have promptly and effectively. To guarantee a smooth and secure experience, we have established a set of comprehensive rights for all of our clients. These rights are outlined below, arranged in order of significance to provide clarity on what you can expect from us as your service provider.</p>
                
                    <h3>1. Delivery of Database</h3>
                    <p>Clients have the right to receive their database in accordance with the specifications agreed upon at the outset of our collaboration. It is our commitment to ensure that the final product aligns with the terms outlined in the original order. Should the delivered database fail to meet these specifications, clients are entitled to a full refund.</p>
                    <p>However, it is important to note that if clients request modifications or adjustments that conflict with the original terms and conditions, a 2% penalty may be applied to the refund. Additionally, if the requested databases include data that violate our policies, such requests will also be canceled, and clients will receive a full refund along with the same 2% penalty. If clients wish to reactivate the work, they must communicate with our customer service channel to resolve any misunderstandings. In this case, clients will be required to pay the full price of the plan without any discounts. Regardless of the circumstances, clients will be informed about any penalties that may be incurred. This policy is designed to protect the interests of both the client and BBS, ensuring fairness and transparency throughout the transaction process.</p>
                
                    <h3>2. Accountability</h3>
                    <p>Every client has the right to demand accountability regarding the management of their data. This includes transparency about how their personal information is handled, as well as the data contained within their databases. Clients are encouraged to inquire about our data protection measures and to seek assurances that their information is being secured and managed responsibly. At BBS, we value accountability and strive to foster trust through open communication.</p>
                
                    <h3>3. Data Security</h3>
                    <p>Clients have the right to expect secure handling and management of their data, as well as any tools provided for data manipulation. We are committed to employing industry best practices in data protection to ensure that client information is handled with the utmost care. Our security protocols are designed to safeguard against unauthorized access, ensuring that your data remains confidential and protected.</p>
                
                    <h3>4. Use of Personal Data</h3>
                    <p>Clients have the right to be informed about how their personal data is used in the execution of our services. This includes clear information on our data collection practices, how data is stored, and any instances of third-party sharing of information. We are dedicated to ensuring that all data handling complies with relevant data protection regulations, providing clients with peace of mind regarding the management of their personal information.</p>
                
                    <h3>5. Service Guarantee</h3>
                    <p>Clients are entitled to the benefits of the agreed-upon guarantee for the services they acquire. This guarantee underscores our dedication to customer satisfaction and includes several key components. Clients can expect prompt responses to their inquiries, ensuring that their questions are addressed in a timely manner. Additionally, our team is committed to providing attention to issues that may arise, offering support whenever challenges occur. Our goal is to achieve rapid resolutions of any problems, reflecting our unwavering commitment to meeting client needs and fostering a positive service experience.</p>
                
                    <h3>6. Services Provided</h3>
                    <p>Every client has the right to receive detailed information regarding the services we offer. This includes a comprehensive overview of the scope of our work, which outlines the specific tasks and objectives that we will undertake. Furthermore, we provide insights into the methodologies employed, giving clients a clear understanding of how we approach each project. Our solutions are tailored to meet specific business needs, ensuring that the services provided align with the unique requirements of each client. This transparency helps clients feel informed and confident in their decisions.</p>
                
                    <h3>7. Progress Tracking</h3>
                    <p>Clients can request visual proof of the development process, which may include screenshots, video captures, or access to real-time progress dashboards. By providing this feature, clients can actively track their project’s status, ensuring transparency and confidence throughout development. This allows for smooth communication, especially in the context of web development, where progress can often be monitored through tools like GitHub, JIRA, or custom progress pages, ensuring the work aligns with their expectations.</p>
                
                    <h3>8. Order Status</h3>
                    <p>Clients are entitled to regular updates about the status of their orders. This commitment to communication ensures that clients are kept informed about the progression of their projects, including timelines and any potential delays. By maintaining transparency in the process, we empower clients to stay connected to the development journey of their databases. This proactive approach not only alleviates concerns but also reinforces the client’s trust in our dedication to delivering quality services.</p>
                
                    <h3>9. Right to Participate in Development</h3>
                    <p>Clients have the right to actively participate in the development process. This engagement allows clients to provide input and feedback at various stages of development, ensuring that the final product aligns with their vision and expectations. We believe that collaboration is key to success, and by involving clients in the process, we can create tailored solutions that truly meet their needs. This participatory approach fosters a sense of ownership and satisfaction in the final outcomes.</p>
                
                    <h3>10. Unlimited Revision Requests</h3>
                    <p>Clients can request an unlimited number of revisions as long as they do not exceed the maximum development timeframe. This policy is designed to ensure that clients have ample opportunity to fine-tune their databases and websites to their satisfaction without incurring additional costs. By allowing unlimited revisions within the agreed timeline, we prioritize client satisfaction and strive to deliver a final product that fully meets their requirements and expectations.</p>
                
                    <h3>11. Communication and Revision Requests</h3>
                    <p>Clients have the right to communicate any requests for information or changes during the project. However, it is important to recognize that the project has a maximum development timeframe of five days. If a client requests revisions within this period, it may affect the guarantee. We encourage clients to use this timeframe effectively to ensure that all their needs are addressed.</p>
                
                    <h3>12. Right to Continuous Support</h3>
                    <p>Clients are entitled to receive ongoing support even after their database or website has been delivered. This support includes help with troubleshooting, guidance on how to use the database, and any necessary updates or maintenance during a designated support period. Whether it’s debugging a database query or updating a website, we are here to provide continuous assistance.</p>
                
                    <h3>13. Transparency</h3>
                    <p>Clients have the right to understand how we operate and manage our services. This includes information about our working methods, communication processes, and how we address client needs. However, we will keep proprietary business secrets confidential to protect our competitive advantage.</p>
                
                    <h3>14. Right to Data Ownership</h3>
                    <p>Upon completion of the project, clients have the right to full ownership of their databases. This means that all intellectual property created during the development process will belong solely to the client, allowing them the freedom to use, modify, or transfer their database as they choose.</p>
                
                    <h3>15. Right to Customization</h3>
                    <p>Clients have the right to request customizations to their database solutions beyond our standard offerings. We are committed to understanding and accommodating each client's unique business needs, ensuring that we deliver tailored solutions that provide the highest value.</p>
                
                    <h3>16. Right to Timely Responses</h3>
                    <p>Clients have the right to expect prompt responses to their inquiries and requests. We are committed to responding to client communications within a specified timeframe, which enhances communication efficiency and overall client satisfaction. By ensuring timely responses, we aim to foster a responsive and supportive environment for our clients.</p>
                
                    <h3>17. Respectful Treatment</h3>
                    <p>Every client is entitled to receive respectful and professional treatment during their entire engagement with us. We believe in nurturing a positive client relationship that emphasizes courtesy and understanding. Our goal is to ensure that clients feel valued and heard, creating an atmosphere where their needs and concerns are addressed with care.</p>
                
                    <h3>18. Right to Reject Policies</h3>
                    <p>Clients have the option to reject our policies if they so choose. However, it is important to note that opting out of our policies means they will not have access to our services. This policy is crucial to ensure that clients fully understand and agree to our terms before proceeding with their purchases. It is designed to protect both the client and the integrity of our services.</p>
                
                    <h3>19. Feedback and Reviews</h3>
                    <p>Clients have the right to submit feedback, leave reviews, and share recommendations at any time. We encourage constructive feedback, as it helps us improve our services. However, we reserve the right to disregard any attempts at spamming or irrelevant comparisons with other providers. Additionally, any reviews that contain inappropriate, offensive, or misleading content will be removed to maintain a constructive and respectful environment for all clients.</p>
                
                    <h3>20. Right to Privacy in Feedback</h3>
                    <p>Clients have the right to provide feedback and reviews anonymously if they prefer. We deeply value all input from our clients and strive to create a safe space where they can share their experiences without fear of retribution or unwanted attention. Ensuring client privacy is a top priority, as it fosters open communication and honest feedback.</p>
                
                    <h3>21. Invoice Request</h3>
                    <p>Clients have the right to request an invoice at any time during their engagement with us. To fulfill this request, clients simply need to provide their email address, first name, and last name. This process ensures that clients have clear and accurate records of their transactions, which is essential for any future claims related to refunds or guarantees. Having an invoice on hand can facilitate smooth communication and resolution of any financial matters that may arise.</p>
                
                    <h3>22. Free Trial Version</h3>
                    <p>Clients are entitled to access a free trial version of our services. This trial is limited to a maximum of four well-optimized tables, along with a tutorial on how to use MySQL, which will be provided through a third-party YouTube video. This allows clients to experience our offerings without any financial risk. It is important to note that this trial version does not come with any guarantees or modifications. Additionally, clients will not be required to provide any payment or compensation to access this trial, allowing them to explore our services fully before making a commitment.</p>
                
                    <h3>23. Enforcement of Rights</h3>
                    <p>Clients have the right to assert the rights outlined in this policy and to ensure that these rights are upheld. If any of our employees fail to meet these standards, clients are encouraged to file complaints directly with us. This feedback is vital for maintaining a high level of service quality and accountability within our organization. By voicing concerns, clients play a key role in helping us improve and ensure that our service meets their expectations.</p>

                    <h3>24. Web Development Service Options "NEW"</h3>
                    <p>Clients have the right to choose their preferred platform for website development. Depending on the complexity and requirements of the project, BBS offers the option of delivering the final product either as raw code or in a WordPress format. Clients will be fully informed about the pros and cons of each option, and we will provide guidance on the best choice based on their needs. Whether opting for code-based solutions for greater customization or WordPress for ease of use and content management, BBS ensures a tailored and high-quality outcome.</p>
                    
                    <h3>25. Development Platform Flexibility "NEW"</h3>
                    <p>Clients have the right to request a switch between the platform options (code or WordPress) at any stage during the project, as long as it does not affect the overall project timeline or incur additional costs due to significant changes in the scope. We will discuss any adjustments necessary and ensure that the final product aligns with the client's expectations, whether in the form of clean, customizable code or a user-friendly WordPress interface.</p>

                    <p><strong>By upholding these rights, BBS is dedicated to fostering a professional and transparent environment. We prioritize client satisfaction in all our business dealings, ensuring that our services are delivered with integrity and respect.</strong></p>

                    <h2>Security and Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>Safeguarding your data is our top priority, and we implement rigorous protocols to ensure its protection. We fully comply with internationally recognized data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), ensuring that all customer data is processed with the utmost confidentiality and security. We collect only the essential information required to facilitate effective communication and execute projects efficiently, specifically limited to your email, name, and surname. In the event that you provide explicit consent, we may securely retain this information for the purpose of providing future updates or promotional offers. However, if consent is not granted, we are committed to securely erasing all customer data upon project completion, maintaining our strict privacy standards and upholding your rights to confidentiality at all times.</p>

                    <h2>Refund and Return Policy</h2>
                    <p>We are committed to ensuring complete client satisfaction, which is why we offer a satisfaction guarantee on all our database projects. During this period, clients are entitled to request revisions and modifications to ensure that the final product aligns with their expectations and specific business needs. Should the client remain unsatisfied after these revisions, and if it falls within the guarantee period (which varies depending on the service), we will issue a full refund of the paid amount without hesitation. However, once this guarantee period has elapsed, no refunds or returns will be permitted under any circumstances. Additionally, any modification requests submitted after this timeframe will be subject to our standard service rates and will incur additional charges. By proceeding with a purchase, the client fully acknowledges and agrees to these terms, ensuring mutual understanding and clarity from the outset.</p>

                    <h2>Service Guarantee</h2>
                    <p>We are fully committed to delivering services that meet the highest standards of quality and customer satisfaction. To reinforce this commitment, all of our services are backed by a <strong>comprehensive quality guarantee</strong>. For the development of a <strong>new database</strong>, clients may request up to <strong>three modifications</strong> during the guarantee period of <strong>7 days</strong>. Modifications to <strong>existing databases</strong> from another developer also come with a guarantee period of <strong>7 days</strong>, entitling clients to up to <strong>ten modifications</strong>. Extensions, however, have a guarantee period of only <strong>5 days</strong>, allowing for <strong>two modifications</strong>. It is important to note that <strong>customer service</strong> will not be counted as part of the guarantee; rather, it is considered a <strong>free right</strong> of the user. This service is available to assist clients with any inquiries or issues related to databases, as established in our service agreements.</p>  
                    <p>It is essential to note that this guarantee may be <strong>annulled</strong> if the client modifies the database during the guarantee period. However, none of our staff can deprive clients of their right to a <strong>fair guarantee</strong> as stipulated in these terms. Should any further modifications be required after the guarantee window has closed, they will be subject to <strong>additional fees</strong> based on our current pricing structure. This policy reflects our unwavering dedication to providing exceptional service and ensuring that every project we deliver meets the specific needs and standards of our clients.</p>

                    <p>At our company, we offer flexible web development solutions tailored to your needs. Depending on your project's requirements, we can develop your website using either custom code or WordPress. Custom code provides greater flexibility and scalability, while WordPress is ideal for businesses looking for a user-friendly, content management system.</p>
                    <p>The delivery time for a fully developed website typically ranges between <strong>7 to 22 days</strong>, depending on the scope and complexity of the project. Simpler websites are delivered faster, while more complex projects with additional features may take longer to ensure the highest quality and functionality.</p>
                    <p>To ensure fair compensation for our developers, a <strong>fair percentage fee</strong> will be applied based on the size and complexity of the project. This fee ensures that the developers are properly compensated for their efforts and expertise. The exact fee will be communicated upfront, and no additional charges will be applied unless the project scope changes during development.</p>
                    <p>Before we begin any project, we require the acquisition of a domain. This is essential for us to initiate the development process and ensure that the website is fully functional and ready for launch once completed.</p>
                    <p>We are committed to delivering high-quality websites and ensuring the satisfaction of all our clients. If you have any specific requirements or questions, feel free to reach out to us for further clarification.</p>

                    <h3>4. Liability Disclaimer</h3>
                    <p>We explicitly disclaim any legal responsibility for issues that may arise from the use or abuse of content hosted on client websites.

                        <h2>Database Content Policies</h2>
                    
                        <h3>1. Prohibited Information</h3>
                        <p>Requests for database columns containing sensitive personal information are strictly prohibited unless they comply fully with legal requirements, such as the <strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</strong>, the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>, the <strong>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</strong>, and any other applicable laws. Sensitive information includes, but is not limited to, <strong>emails</strong>, <strong>phone numbers</strong>, <strong>passport numbers</strong>, or other personal identification details. For healthcare-related businesses, especially private clinics, HIPAA regulations apply to any request that involves health-related data, ensuring that sensitive health information is handled in accordance with strict privacy and security rules.</p>
                        
                        <p>The only personal information allowed without specific legal documentation is the client’s <strong>name</strong> and <strong>surname</strong>. Any request for additional personal data, such as health information regulated by <strong>HIPAA</strong>, must be backed by valid legal documentation and certifications. These legal certifications must prove that the client is authorized to handle the data and is fully compliant with the respective privacy laws. If the appropriate legal permissions are not in place, requests for such data will be strictly prohibited.</p>
                    
                        <p>
                            <strong>Prohibited data includes, but is not limited to: </strong><br>
                            1. Location data <br>
                            2. Email addresses <br>
                            3. Phone numbers <br>
                            4. Social media profiles <br>
                            5. Postal codes <br>
                            6. Bank account numbers <br>
                            7. Credit card details <br>
                            8. National ID numbers <br>
                            9. Passport numbers <br>
                            10. Medical records <br>
                            11. Personal data of minors <br>
                            Any other sensitive, traceable, or financial data.
                        </p>
                    
                        <h3>Encryption Requirements</h3>
                        <p>To protect the integrity and security of the data, any database columns that contain sensitive information must be encrypted. Clients can either choose to handle this encryption themselves or request our services to ensure that these columns are encrypted securely. If these encryption requirements are not fulfilled, requests for such columns will not be processed under any circumstances.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Compliance and Responsibility</h3>
                        <p>It is critical that clients understand and commit to full legal compliance when requesting any data for their databases. This compliance is not optional but a mandatory requirement to ensure the safety and regulatory integrity of your business. We emphasize that it is the client's responsibility to provide all necessary legal documentation proving their right to request and handle sensitive data. Failure to meet these legal obligations will result in the rejection of data requests. Adhering to these laws not only protects your users but also safeguards your business against legal and regulatory risks.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Exceptions</h3>
                        <p>Exceptions to this policy will only be made when the client provides valid legal certification, such as <strong>GDPR compliance</strong>, <strong>CCPA certification</strong>, or <strong>HIPAA compliance</strong> for healthcare-related data. For healthcare businesses or any entity handling electronic health records (EHR), HIPAA sets strict guidelines for the handling of sensitive health data. In these cases, clients must ensure that their users have been fully informed and have provided explicit consent for their data to be used and stored as required by law.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Liability Disclaimer</h3>
                        <p>BBS explicitly disclaims any legal responsibility for issues that may arise from the improper use or insufficient protection of your database. This includes, but is not limited to, situations involving data breaches, hacking incidents, or violations of data privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). While our team is committed to providing robust solutions designed to help your business maintain security and compliance with these pertinent regulations, including HIPAA for healthcare-related data, it is essential to understand that the ultimate responsibility for the protection and management of the database rests with the client. This responsibility encompasses all aspects of data handling, including ensuring appropriate security measures, adherence to legal requirements, and the implementation of best practices for data privacy and protection.</p>
                    
                        <h3>2. Optimization</h3>
                        <p>All databases delivered include indexed fields designed to ensure optimal performance and are structured for immediate use upon delivery. This built-in indexing facilitates efficient data retrieval and enhances overall database functionality, allowing clients to seamlessly integrate the solution into their existing systems.
                            However, it is important to note that <strong>temporary tables and common table expressions (CTEs) are not included</strong> in our database development service. Clients wishing to utilize these features must request them separately through the BBS Database Extension service, which incurs an additional cost.
                            Should clients or their designated engineers require temporary tables or CTEs, these components must be managed independently following the purchase. Additionally, if any modifications, including the addition of these elements, are made within 7 days after receiving the database, it will result in the nullification of the warranty associated with the database.
                            This policy underscores the importance of maintaining the integrity and intended functionality of the database as delivered, while ensuring that clients are fully aware of their responsibilities regarding any post-delivery modifications.</p>
                    
                        <h3>3. Modifications</h3>
                        <p>Clients are entitled to request between <strong>2 to 10 complimentary modifications</strong> within the guarantee period, which ranges from <strong>3 to 7 days</strong>, depending on the service requested. This provision allows them to fine-tune the database according to their specific needs and preferences, ensuring that the final product aligns closely with their operational requirements and expectations. For existing databases, clients can request up to <strong>ten modifications</strong> within the guarantee period, while extensions allow for only <strong>two modifications</strong>. It is essential to note that any modification requests submitted after the guarantee period, or requests that exceed the allotted modifications, will incur additional charges. The cost of these extra modifications will be determined based on the complexity and scope of the changes requested.</p> 
                        <p>Furthermore, if clients violate the terms or modify the database independently during the guarantee period, this will result in the cancellation of their entitlement to complimentary modifications. This policy is designed to maintain transparency in our pricing structure while providing clients with the flexibility to enhance their database solutions as needed.</p>
                    
                        <h3>4. Delivery and Guarantee</h3>
                        <p>Customized databases are delivered within a maximum timeframe of 5 business days, ensuring that clients receive their solutions promptly and can begin implementation without unnecessary delays. In the event that a client is not satisfied with the result, we offer a money-back guarantee, provided that the dissatisfaction is communicated within the guarantee period. It is important to note that any manipulation of the database that damages its optimization or alters its structure during the guarantee period will automatically void the guarantee. We cannot be held responsible for how the database is utilized or any modifications made by the client after it has been delivered. Once the database is in the client's possession, the responsibility for its use and any resulting implications rests solely with the client, including how it is adapted to meet their specific objectives.</p>
                    
                        <h3>5. Payment</h3>
                        <p>Payments must be completed prior to the commencement of the database development process, ensuring that all financial arrangements are settled before any work begins. All transactions are securely processed through PayPal, specifically directed to the PayPal account of the founder, Aaron Obando. However, this payment method may be updated in future releases to provide greater flexibility and convenience for our clients. Pricing structures are determined based on the selected service plan, as well as the scope, extension, and modification of the database, according to established rates. It's important to note that all our services are offered as one-time payments, with no recurring charges. In the event of an incomplete or accidental payment, we will proactively reach out to the client to confirm their preference—either to process a refund or to finalize the outstanding payment. If a refund is requested due to an incomplete payment, the 5%-10% penalty typically associated with refunds will not apply, recognizing that the charge was unintentional. Furthermore, in instances of overpayment, the excess amount will be promptly refunded to the client. This payment policy applies to all of our services, ensuring consistency and clarity across our offerings while maintaining transparency in our financial processes.</p>

                <li><a href="#database-automation-policies" onclick="toggleContent('database-automation-policies', event)">Database Automation Policies</a></li>
<div id="database-automation-policies" class="policy-content">
    <h2>Database Automation Policies</h2>
    <p>At BBS, we prioritize the scalability, flexibility, and extendability of all database solutions. In order to ensure optimal performance and maintainability, we implement automation techniques such as <strong>stored procedures</strong> and <strong>triggers</strong> to streamline data processes. However, to preserve flexibility and allow for easy customization and future extension, we adhere to the following guidelines:</p>
    
    <h3>1. Limited Use of Stored Procedures and Triggers</h3>
    <p>For each database table, a maximum of two stored procedures and/or triggers will be implemented. These automation tools will only be used when absolutely necessary to achieve specific business requirements or optimize performance. This limitation ensures that the database remains easily customizable, scalable, and maintainable, allowing for future expansions and modifications without unnecessary complexity.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Need-Based Implementation</h3>
    <p>Stored procedures and triggers will be created only where their use is justified based on the complexity and requirements of the database system. We aim to minimize their implementation in order to avoid performance degradation and to preserve the ability for quick, custom updates. Every use case for automation will be carefully evaluated to ensure it provides clear and significant benefits to the overall system's efficiency.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Customization and Extensibility</h3>
    <p>Our approach is designed to balance automation with customization. While we integrate stored procedures and triggers where needed, we also ensure that clients can easily modify and extend their systems without being hindered by excessive automation. This allows clients to adapt the database as their business grows and new requirements arise.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Documentation and Support</h3>
    <p>Each stored procedure and trigger will be fully documented, ensuring that clients can understand their function and make any necessary adjustments in the future. Our support team is also available to assist clients with any questions or changes related to these automated processes, ensuring that they remain empowered to manage their databases effectively.</p>

In such cases, a refund of 97% of the payment made will be issued, subject to a 3% penalty. Additionally, BBS may report such incidents on social media platforms, and the client's ability to provide feedback may be restricted. This policy is in place to ensure a safe and respectful environment for all clients and staff.</p>

    <h3>4. Confidentiality and Data Protection</h3>
    <p>Clients have a responsibility to protect sensitive information that is shared with BBS, particularly with regards to web development and database management. This means that clients must refrain from disclosing any confidential or strategic details that could compromise their own business or that of BBS. Safeguarding this information is crucial for maintaining trust and ensuring that both parties can operate securely and effectively.</p>

    <h3>5. Respect for Intellectual Property</h3>
    <p>Clients must respect the intellectual property rights of BBS, particularly regarding web development, design, and database structures.

It is strictly prohibited to use the BBS logo, replicate the website, or request access to the database code for commercial purposes. Additionally, clients are not allowed to attempt to purchase multiple databases or websites with the intention of reselling or redistributing them. If BBS becomes aware of any violations of its intellectual property rights, it reserves the right to take appropriate legal action to protect its interests.</p>

    <h3>6. Payment Obligations</h3>

    <h3>8. Cooperation, Communication, and Active Participation</h3>
    <p>Open and effective communication is essential for the success of any project, including website and database development. Clients are expected to maintain active communication with BBS throughout the development process. This involves promptly responding to inquiries, providing necessary feedback, and participating in discussions regarding the project’s status. Insufficient communication or lack of active participation may lead to delays, complications in service delivery, or less than optimal results. By engaging actively, clients contribute to a more efficient and effective project experience.</p>

    <h3>9. Adherence to Policies</h3>
    <p>Clients are required to comply with all company policies established by BBS, which include guidelines related to refunds, modifications, web development changes, and data security. Understanding and accepting these policies is crucial for ensuring a smooth and efficient collaboration between clients and BBS. Familiarity with these policies will help clients navigate the service process effectively and avoid misunderstandings.</p>

    <h3>10. Acknowledgment of Risks</h3>
    <p>Clients must acknowledge and accept the inherent risks associated with database and web development, such as potential data loss, security breaches, or system failures. By proceeding with the services offered by BBS, clients agree to hold BBS harmless for any issues that may arise as a result of these risks. This acknowledgment is essential for setting realistic expectations and promoting informed decision-making.</p>

    <h3>11. Responsibility in Decision-Making</h3>
    <p>Clients must take full responsibility for the decisions they make regarding the configuration and use of their databases and websites. This includes conducting adequate testing and validation to ensure that the final product meets their expectations before full implementation. Clients are encouraged to actively engage in the development process to confirm that the website or database functions as intended and serves their business needs.</p>

    <h3>12. Acceptance of Consequences for Changes or Modifications</h3>
    <p>If clients request modifications to the database or website after delivery, they must accept that such changes may void any warranty provided by BBS. Additionally, any resulting issues or complications from these modifications will be the sole responsibility of the client. It is important for clients to carefully consider any changes they wish to make post-delivery, as they may impact the overall functionality of the website or database.</p>

    <h3>13. Evaluation of Progress</h3>
    <p>Clients are encouraged to periodically review and evaluate the progress of their database and website development. Regular evaluations help ensure that the project aligns with their needs and expectations. By staying involved and providing feedback during the development process, clients can contribute to a final product that meets their business objectives.</p>

    <p>Clients must ensure that any specific information or resources necessary for the development process are readily available and accessible to BBS. This includes providing access to platforms, relevant documentation, or internal personnel who can assist with web development. By facilitating access to these resources, clients help ensure a smooth and efficient development process.</p>

    <h3>15. Use of External Resources</h3>
    <p>If clients choose to utilize third-party tools or resources in conjunction with BBS services, including web development platforms, they are responsible for ensuring that these resources are compatible with BBS's offerings. It is important for clients to verify that any external tools or resources do not interfere with the functionality of the deliverables provided by BBS. This diligence helps maintain the effectiveness and reliability of the overall project.</p>

    <h3>16. Feedback and Reviews</h3>
    <p>Clients are encouraged to share constructive feedback and reviews based on their experiences with BBS. Such feedback is invaluable for improving our services and ensuring client satisfaction. However, any attempts to submit spam, defamatory remarks, or unjustified comparisons with other service providers will not be tolerated. Such content will be promptly removed to maintain a respectful and constructive environment. Clients who repeatedly violate these guidelines may face restrictions on their ability to leave future feedback, as we aim to foster a positive and professional exchange.</p>

    <h3>17. Conflict Resolution</h3>
    <p>Clients are encouraged to engage in good faith efforts to resolve any conflicts or disagreements that may arise during their engagement with BBS. This involves direct communication with BBS to address and resolve issues before escalating them to higher authorities or making public complaints.

    <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Automatic cancellation of the order and a prohibition on future interactions.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Using aggressive language while requesting service modifications, whether for database or web development services, would fall under this category.</p>

    <h3>8. Dissemination of False Information</h3>
    <p><strong>Penalty:</strong> 10%-15% of the total order amount</p>
    <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Automatic cancellation of the order and prohibition from engaging with our platform for a specified duration.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Spreading misinformation about our database or web development services to mislead potential clients can lead to this penalty.</p>

    <h3>9. Disrespectful Conduct Toward BBS or Its Employees</h3>
    <p><strong>Penalty:</strong> 3%-5% of the total order amount</p>
    <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Temporary suspension from using our services and a warning regarding future interactions.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Any form of disrespectful communication with our team can result in penalties.</p>

    <h3>10. Delivery of Database or Web Development Services</h3>
    <p><strong>Penalty:</strong> 2% of the total order amount (if modifications conflict with original terms)</p>
    <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Full refund if the delivered database or website fails to meet specifications; however, a 2% penalty may be applied to the refund for modification requests that conflict with original terms.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a client requests changes to their website or database that go against the original agreement, they may incur a penalty on their refund.</p>

    <h3>11. Modification of New or Unused Databases or Websites from Other Providers</h3>
    <p><strong>Penalty:</strong> 5% of the total order amount</p>
    <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> The modification fee for an existing database or website from another provider will apply, and the modification will still be subject to the guarantee provided under this policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a client modifies a database or website obtained from another provider without prior consultation, they may incur a penalty on their refund.</p>

    <p>In extreme cases, we will engage in dialogue with the responsible party using ethical conflict resolution methods, ensuring no form of coercion, offense, or violation of personal integrity occurs during this process. Clients are encouraged to reach out through our customer service channels to discuss misunderstandings, violations of terms and conditions due to inadvertence, or copyright issues related to both database and web development services.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Any actions that violate these policies, whether due to inadvertence, ignorance, or disrespect towards clients or the company, will be treated with the utmost seriousness. This includes distributing misleading information, unauthorized use of client data, abrupt refund requests, attempts at extortion or bribery, plagiarism, or any other illegal, criminal, or offensive practices. Such behaviors are completely intolerable and may be subject to legal action in severe cases.</p>

    <p><strong>Restoration of Benefits:</strong> Clients whose services have been suspended due to policy violations may regain access by providing a written apology along with a signed acknowledgment that they have read and agree to the terms and conditions.

    <h2>Shipping Policies</h2>
    <p>All services are delivered electronically, with email being the <strong>primary method of delivery</strong>. For added convenience, clients may choose to receive their services via <strong>cloud storage platforms</strong> such as OneDrive or Google Drive, or alternatively, the service can be delivered as a <strong>WordPress installation</strong> or <strong>as a zip file containing the code</strong>, depending on the client's preference. A unique shareable link will be provided through email based on the client's choice. The delivery of all services is <strong>guaranteed within a maximum timeframe of 7 business days</strong>.</p>
    <p>Please note that once the 7-day delivery period has passed, the share link will expire, and no claims will be accepted thereafter. To assist clients, we will send <strong>three reminders</strong> during this period if confirmation of receipt is not received. For security reasons, we will not send files outside of a cloud storage platform. To obtain the database, clients must use the download link via Google Drive or OneDrive that will be sent on the delivery day, or if they requested WordPress delivery, they will receive login credentials to access the website directly.</p>
    <p>In the event that a <strong>refund is requested for undelivered services</strong>, a <strong>5%-10% recovery fee</strong> will be applied, and this condition is accepted upon confirmation of purchase.</p>

<li><a href="#encryption-policies" onclick="toggleContent('encryption-policies', event)">Encryption Policy</a></li>
<div id="encryption-policies" class="policy-content">
    <h2>Encryption Policy</h2>
    <p>Clients have the option to request <strong>MySQL database encryption</strong> during the order process. We utilize the <strong>AES_Encrypt</strong> command for this purpose. It is essential to understand that while encryption significantly enhances data security, it is advisable to use it judiciously and primarily in scenarios where sensitive information needs protection.</p>
    
    <p>For databases such as <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, we support encryption through industry-standard methods, ensuring your data remains secure. PostgreSQL offers robust encryption features, which can be applied with ease. For <strong>SQLite</strong>, while encryption is not natively supported, we recommend utilizing third-party extensions, such as SQLCipher, for implementing encryption in your SQLite databases.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Microsoft Access</strong>, however, does not natively support database-level encryption. While it is possible to protect individual objects within the database (like setting passwords on databases or encrypting data within fields), it does not provide a comprehensive encryption solution for the entire database system. Clients should be aware of this limitation when choosing Microsoft Access for their database needs.</p>
    
    <p>Encryption may result in a performance loss during data analysis, so we encourage clients to carefully evaluate whether the benefits of encrypting specific data outweigh the potential impact on system performance. Additionally, clients must allocate a secure location for storing the passwords associated with the encrypted data. This is crucial for maintaining both the integrity and accessibility of the encryption process.</p>
    
    <p>We will provide the passwords for the encrypted columns; however, the responsibility for securely storing these passwords lies entirely with the client. By opting for encryption, clients acknowledge and accept these terms and conditions, ensuring they are fully aware of the implications and responsibilities associated with encrypting their databases.</p>

                <li><a href="#database-extension-policies" onclick="toggleContent('database-extension-policies', event)">Database Extension Policies by Plan</a></li>
                <div id="database-extension-policies" class="policy-content">
                        <h2>Database Extension Policies by Plan</h2>
                        <p>Each plan includes a 3-day guarantee, allowing clients up to two free modifications or adjustments within this period. As previously mentioned, this guarantee may be nullified if the client independently modifies the database after it has been extended and delivered. This policy specifically applies to databases created by our company. In cases where the client wishes to modify an existing database, the applicable fees may differ. Therefore, it is necessary for clients to contact us first to discuss the specific requirements and any associated costs. As an optional extra, clients may also request the addition of temporary tables and common table expressions (CTEs) as part of their database modifications.</p>
                        
                        <h3>1. Basic Plan</h3>
                        <p>Clients on the Basic Plan can request up to 4 additional tables or 8 additional columns per order. If more modifications are needed beyond this scope, a new request can be submitted within 24 hours of the initial changes. This structured approach ensures that clients receive the necessary enhancements while maintaining clarity in the modification process.</p>
                        
                        <h3>2. Standard Plan</h3>
                        <p>The Standard Plan includes the option for clients to request up to 4 additional tables or a total of 20 additional columns per order. As with the Basic Plan, further modifications can be requested within 24 hours of the initial adjustments, allowing clients to make necessary changes promptly and efficiently.</p>
                        
                        <h3>3. Business Plan</h3>
                        <p>The Business Plan offers unlimited changes, ensuring that all client needs are met without restriction.

                <li><a href="#existing-database-modifications" onclick="toggleContent('existing-database-modifications', event)">Policies for Existing Database Modifications</a></li>
                <div id="existing-database-modifications" class="policy-content">
                        <h2>Policies for Existing Database Modifications</h2>
                    
                        <h3>1. Guarantee</h3>
                        <p>Modifications to existing databases are covered by a 7-day guarantee, during which clients can request additional changes free of charge. It is crucial to understand that this guarantee may be voided if the client independently alters the database once it has been delivered. Clients must agree to our terms and conditions before initiating any modifications, as this ensures mutual understanding and accountability throughout the process.</p>
                    
                        <h3>2. Recommendation</h3>
                        <p>We strongly recommend that clients maintain a backup of their database prior to requesting any changes. Modifying a previously used database without careful consideration and a well-planned approach may lead to unforeseen issues. While we will not add anything that the client has not specifically requested, it is essential to acknowledge that unauthorized modifications may impact the database's functionality and optimal usage. Our team is available to provide guidance and suggest potential adjustments that align with the client's needs while safeguarding the original data structure and design. However, the client assumes full responsibility for any complications that may arise from changes made to the database. We are committed to delivering professional work and will address any inquiries, suggestions, and requests. We will also provide recommendations to ensure that the changes do not disrupt the hierarchical schema or hinder data manipulation and analysis.</p>
                    
                        <h3>3. Accepted Formats</h3>
                        <p>We only modify MySQL and SQLite databases. All files must be submitted in their original export format, compressed into a ZIP file. We do not require direct access to the client's database server for modifications, streamlining the process for both parties. It is advisable to send the database in an unencrypted ZIP format to facilitate modifications according to the client's specifications. If the database is encrypted, please provide a document containing the passwords for the encrypted columns. This is optional, as encryptions are typically applied only to specific columns; however, providing the passwords will allow us to work with your data more effectively, should the need arise.</p>
            
                        <h3>4. Client Responsibility</h3>
                        <p>It is the client’s responsibility to ensure compliance with legal requirements when it comes to sensitive data. Adding sensitive information to the database is strictly prohibited unless the client possesses valid certification or permission verifying their legal right to use such data. This certification must demonstrate that the client has obtained the necessary consent from users regarding the use of their sensitive information.</p>
                    
                        <h3>5. Liability Disclaimer</h3>
                        <p>Neither our company nor Aaron Obando, the founder, will be held liable for any oversight or data loss resulting from modifications, the failure to conduct backups, security vulnerabilities leading to data breaches, or any cyberattacks that may occur during or after the modification process. Clients must prioritize data protection and implement adequate security measures to safeguard their information.</p>
                    
                        <h3>6. Modification Fees</h3>
                        <p>The cost for modifications is structured based on the complexity and size of the database. For databases with 5 to 8 tables or approximately 5,000 records, the fee is $149. For those with 8 to 12 tables or around 25,000 records, the charge increases to $849. For databases exceeding 12 tables and classified as intensive or enterprise use (with more than 60,000 records), the fee is set at $1,999. These prices reflect the intricacies of the work and the risks involved. Clients acknowledge and accept these terms upon proceeding with modifications.</p>
                    
                        <h3>7. Cancellation and Refunds</h3>
                        <p>This service incurs a 10% penalty for refunds, applicable both for cancellations prior to the initiation of work and for completed work. This measure is instituted to ensure the integrity of our business. In the event of a refund request, clients will receive a backup copy made by us, along with the modified version that proved most functional for their needs.</p>
                    
                        <h3>8. Commitment to Client Satisfaction</h3>
                        <p>Our dedication is to maintain client satisfaction and the optimal functioning of their databases. Clients need not worry about losing their work, as we will perform regular backups, including any changes made that the client approves. The special guarantee for this service allows for up to 10 changes within the 7-day window. However, this guarantee will be voided if the client alters the database after delivery. Therefore, we encourage clients to thoroughly read and understand these policies before proceeding with any modifications.</p>
                    
                        <h3>9. Modification of New or Unused Databases from Other Providers</h3>
                        <p>If the database being modified is an existing one that was acquired from another provider or developer and has not been used prior or contains between 0 to 2000 records, the modification fee will be set at $119. This applies only to databases from other providers or developers. In the case of our databases, the extension fee must be paid separately, as previously mentioned. This modification will still be subject to the guarantee provided under this policy, allowing for a maximum of 5 changes within the specified timeframe. As previously indicated, the guarantee may be voided if the client modifies the database independently during the guarantee period. Additionally, a refund penalty of 5% will apply in this case. Clients are encouraged to review the terms and conditions applicable to these modifications to ensure compliance and understanding of the process.</p>

                    <p>We are also expanding our database offerings to include broader support for PostgreSQL and Microsoft Access, alongside our previously offered MySQL and SQLite databases. This expansion allows clients to choose from a variety of platforms, depending on their specific requirements and preferences. With PostgreSQL and Microsoft Access now available, we are committed to delivering more versatile and comprehensive database solutions.</p>
                    
                    <p>Additionally, we will introduce advanced query execution capabilities to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of data retrieval, ensuring our clients can extract actionable insights from their data faster and more effectively.
